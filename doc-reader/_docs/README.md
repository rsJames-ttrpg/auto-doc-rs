# 🚀 Project Analysis

## Overview
A documentation reader CLI application that serves as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, providing programmatic access to project documentation and source code files. The system enables automated extraction, formatting, and retrieval of file contents from configured project components with configurable depth traversal and filtering capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture
The application follows a modular Rust architecture with three main layers: a CLI interface built with clap for command handling, a configuration management system supporting multiple file formats (JSON/TOML/YAML), and a tools subsystem that implements MCP-compliant documentation retrieval. The system uses async/await patterns with tokio runtime and integrates with the MCP framework for tool execution and protocol compliance.

## 🛠️ Core Technologies
- **Rust programming language**
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) framework**
- **Tokio async runtime**
- **Clap CLI framework**
- **Serde serialization**
- **Tracing for logging**
- **Config crate for configuration management**

## 🔌 Main Interfaces
- **CLI Commands** (`🌐 API`)
  Command-line interface supporting serve, config generation, and shell completion commands
- **MCP Server** (`🌐 API`)
  Model Context Protocol server that exposes documentation retrieval tools to MCP clients
- **GetDocumentationTool** (`🔧 Function`)
  Core tool that retrieves and formats file contents from project components with configurable depth and filtering
- **Configuration System** (`⚙️ Configuration`)
  Multi-format configuration system (JSON/TOML/YAML) for managing projects and their components

## 🔧 Development Considerations
- Requires Rust toolchain and Cargo for building
- Depends on MCP core libraries for protocol compliance
- Configuration files must be properly formatted in supported formats
- File system permissions needed for reading project directories
- Async runtime (tokio) required for server operation

## 🔗 Extension Points
- Additional MCP tools can be added to the tools module
- New configuration file formats can be supported through FileType enum
- Custom file filtering logic can be implemented in the traversal system
- Additional CLI commands can be added through clap subcommands
- New project component types can be defined in the settings system

## ⚠️ Risk Factors
- **File System Access** (`⚙️ Configuration`)
  Unrestricted file system traversal could expose sensitive files or cause performance issues with large directories
- **MCP Framework Dependency** (`📁 Module`)
  Heavy reliance on external MCP core libraries creates dependency risk and potential compatibility issues
- **Configuration File Security** (`🗄️ Data Model`)
  Configuration files may contain sensitive path information and lack validation for malicious paths
- **Memory Usage** (`🔧 Function`)
  Loading large files or deep directory traversals could cause memory exhaustion without proper limits
