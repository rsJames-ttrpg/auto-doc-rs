# ðŸ“„ File Analysis: `./src/analysis/summary.rs`

**Type:** `rs`

## Summary
This file defines the core data structures and traits for a hierarchical code analysis system that uses LLMs to analyze files, directories, and entire projects. It provides structured analysis types (FileAnalysis, DirectoryAnalysis, ProjectAnalysis) and implements an LlmAnalyzer trait that coordinates with LLM clients to perform automated code documentation and summarization.
